\title{Compute differentially expressed genes with FindMarkers}
\usage{
diff_expressed(
  object,
  condition_1 = c(),
  condition_2 = c(),
  logfc.treshold = 0.25,
  assay = "RNA",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \link{mapping.organism-class} object with \code{Idents(object)}
assigned to variables with the conditions being tested.}

\item{condition_1}{A vector with the elements of the first factor to perform
the hypothesis test. By default the mapped cell types
\code{condition_1 = names(slot(object, "celltype_mapping"))}}

\item{condition_2}{A vector with the elements of the second factor to perform
the hypothesis test with. By default the class of the organism
\code{condition_2 = c(slot(object, "target_class"), slot(object, "base_class"))}}

\item{logfc.treshold}{Sets the minimum log-fold change (logFC) cutoff for
identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). By default
\code{logfc.treshold = 0.25}}

\item{assay}{Specific assay being used for analysis. By default
\code{assay = RNA}.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to pass onto \code{Seurat::FindMarkers()}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the \code{Seurat::FindMarkers} output for the interaction
of two conditions of the \code{slot(object, counts)} matrix
}
\description{
Computes differentially expressed genes with FindMarkers for the conditions
indicated.

\examples{
# Set the identities
data <- celltype_mapping(example_mapping_organism)
slot(data, "counts")$test <- paste0(slot(data, "counts")$celltype_cluster,
"_", slot(data, "counts")$class)
SeuratObject::Idents(slot(data, "counts")) <- "test"
